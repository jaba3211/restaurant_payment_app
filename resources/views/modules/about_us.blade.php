                        In the fast food or restaurant business in general, customers have to communicate directly with employees when choosing or paying for a menu, which often requires a lot of time, in some cases high load leads to queues and an uncomfortable environment. On the Georgian market there are often no food facilities where these processes are automated using appropriate software.
                        Our goal is to automate these processes through a web app that allows us to save time, avoid queues, and simplify payments by avoiding direct use of cash and credit cards. The app will allow the client to order and pay for the restaurant without contacting the waiter.
                        To identify the restaurant, the application will use the QR code placed on the table, after which the application will download the restaurant menu, after selecting the desired dishes from the menu, the client will pay the amount and then the order will be placed.
